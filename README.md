This is a work-in-progress golang port of the [imgmin](https://github.com/rflynn/imgmin/) package.

The current tests just check to make sure that we get the same results as the C version.

To get started, install the ImageMagick library (`brew install imagemagick` or `apt-get install libmagickwand-dev`).

To run the tests:

    > make test

Cool? Cool.
